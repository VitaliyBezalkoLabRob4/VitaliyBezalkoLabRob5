	In a typical AC motor, a rotating magnetic field is produced in the stator winding. The speed of this rotating field is called the synchronous speed and is determined only by the frequency of the power supply and the number of magnetic poles of the machine. A synchronous motor is one in which the rotor rotates at the same speed as the rotating magnetic field in the stator. An asynchronous motor is one in which the rotor rotates at a speed slower than the synchronous speed.
	An induction or asynchronous motor is an AC electric motor in which the electric current in the rotor needed to produce torque is obtained by electromagnetic induction from the magnetic field of the stator winding. An induction motor therefore does not require mechanical commutation, separate-excitation or self-excitation for all or part of the energy transferred from stator to rotor, as in universal, DC and large synchronous motors. An induction motor's rotor can be either wound type or squirrel-cage type
	Three-phase beaver-cage induction motors are widely used in industrial drives because they are rugged, reliable and economical. Fourth-phase induction motors are used extensively for smaller loads, such as household appliances like fans.
